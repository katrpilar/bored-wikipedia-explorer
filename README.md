# Bored Random Page Wikipedia Explorer

## Overview

This CLI allows the user to select from a list of main topics on Wikipedia then randomly selects an overview portal page for the user to browse. If the user doesn't like the selected sub-topic they can choose to reroll within the same main topic they've already selected or they can choose a different topic. When installed properly the CLI will automatically open up the sub-topic portal page in the default browser once the user confirms that they would like to visit it.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'bored-wikipedia-explorer'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install bored-wikipedia-explorer

## Usage
